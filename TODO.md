# TODO

- [ ] Control how many backups to keep (and seperate between auto/manual, the system Timeshift uses is a good starting point)
- [x] Add a way to list backups (without running `restore`)
- [x] Save themes from `~/.themes` and `/usr/share/themes`
- [x] Save icons from `~/.local/share/icons`, `/usr/share/icons`, and `~/.icons`
- [x] Save fonts from `~/.local/share/fonts`, `/usr/share/fonts`, and `~/.fonts`
- [x] Delete all existing Cinnamon dconf settings before restoring
- [x] More granular control for what does and doesn't get saved
