# TODO

- [ ] Control how many backups to keep (and seperate between auto/manual, the system Timeshift uses is a good starting point)
- [ ] Add a way to list backups (without running `restore`)
- [ ] Save themes from `~/.themes` and `/usr/share/themes`
- [ ] Save icons from `~/.local/share/icons`, `/usr/share/icons`, and `~/.icons`
- [ ] Save fonts from `~/.local/share/fonts`, `/usr/share/fonts`, and `~/.fonts`
- [ ] Delete all existing Cinnamon dconf settings before restoring
